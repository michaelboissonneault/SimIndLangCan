"[1] Excludes census data for one or more incompletely enumerated Indian reserves or Indian settlements."
"[2] Users should be aware that the estimates associated with this variable are more affected than most by the incomplete enumeration of certain Indian reserves and Indian settlements in the 2016 Census of Population. For more information on Aboriginal variables, including information on their classifications, the questions from which they are derived, data quality and their comparability with other sources of data, refer to the Aboriginal Peoples Reference Guide, Census of Population, 2016 and the Aboriginal Peoples Technical Report, Census of Population, 2016."

"[3] The category 'Total - Single and multiple mother tongue responses' indicates the number of respondents who reported each language, either as their only response, or in combination with another language. Total responses represent the sum of single mother tongue responses and multiple mother tongue responses received in the census."
"[4] A single mother tongue response occurs when a respondent provides one language only."
"[5] A multiple mother tongue response occurs when a respondent provides two or more languages."
"[6] This is a total population count. The sum of the languages in this table is greater than the total population count because a person may report more than one language in the census."
"[6] n.i.e. = not included elsewhere n.o.s. = not otherwise specified"
