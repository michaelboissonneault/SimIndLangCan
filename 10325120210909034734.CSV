"Note"
"[1] Excludes census data for one or more incompletely enumerated Indian reserves or Indian settlements."
"[2] The category 'Total - Single and multiple language responses' indicates the number of respondents who reported each language, either as their only response or in addition to one or more other languages. Total responses represent the sum of single language responses and multiple language responses received in the census."
"[3] A single language response occurs when a respondent provides one language only."
"[4] A multiple language response occurs when a respondent provides two or more languages."
"[5] This is a total population count. The sum of  the languages in this table is greater than the total population count because a person may report more than one language in the census."
